<h1>Dealing with Compiler Errors - Surviving the Compilation Process</h1>

<div style="margin-right: 1em; float:left; padding: .4em; border-right: 1px solid #bbb"><img src=http://static.cprogramming.com/main_images/alex-50-50.jpg height="50" width="50" border=0 style="padding: 0.25em;"><br><a href=https://plus.google.com/113987539774523532573?rel=author> By Alex Allain</a></div>

It's your first C (or C++) program--it's not that long, and you're about to
compile it.  You hit compile (or enter the build command) and wait.  Your
compiler spits out fifty lines of text.  You pick out words like "warning and
"error".  <em>Does that mean it worked?</em> you wonder.  You look for the
resulting executable.  Nothing.  <em>Damn</em>, you think, <em>I guess I have
to figure out what this all means...</em>

<h2>The Types of Compilation Errors</h2>

First, let's distinguish between the types of errors: most compilers will give
three types of compile-time alerts: compiler warnings, compiler errors, and
linker errors.  

<br><br>
Although you don't want to ignore them, compiler warnings aren't something
severe enough to actually keep your program from compiling.  Usually, compiler
warnings are an indication that something might go wrong at runtime.  How can
the compiler know this at all?  You might be making a typical mistake that the
compiler knows about.  A common example is using the assignment operator ('=')
instead of the equality operator ('==') inside an if statement.  Your compiler
may also warn you about using variables that haven't been initialized and other
similar mistakes.  Generally, you can set the warning level of your compiler--I
like to keep it at its highest level so that my compiler warnings don't turn in
to bugs in the running program ('runtime bugs').

<br><br>
Nevertheless, compiler warnings aren't going to stop you from getting your
program working (unless you tell your compiler to treat warnings as errors), so
they're probably a bit less frustrating than errors.  Errors are conditions
that prevent the compiler from completing the compilation of your files.
Compiler errors are restricted to single source code files and are the result
of 'syntax errors'.  What this really means is that you've done something that
the compiler cannot understand.  For instance, the statement "for(;)" isn't
correct syntax because a for loop always needs to have three parts.  Although
the compiler would have expected a semicolon, it would also have expected a
conditional expression, so the error message you get might be something like
"line 53, unexpected parenthesis ')'".  Note, also, that compiler errors will
always include a line number at which the error was detected.  

<br><br>
Even if you make it through the compilation process successfully, you may run
into linker errors.  Linker errors, unlike compiler errors, have nothing to do
with incorrect syntax.  Instead, linker errors are usually problems with
finding the definitions for functions, structs, classes, or global variables
that were <a href="../declare_vs_define.html">declared, but never actually defined</a>, in a source code file.
Generally, these errors will be of the form "could not find definition for X".

<br><br> 
Usually, the compilation process will begin with a series of compiler
errors and warnings and, once you've fixed all of them, you'll then be faced
with any linker errors.  In turn, I'll first cover dealing with compiler errors
and then with linker errors.


<h2>Compiler Errors - Where do you start?</h2>

If you're faced with a list of fifty or sixty error and warning messages, it
can be daunting to even try to figure out where to start.  The best place,
though, is at the beginning--as in, the beginning of the list.  In fact, you
should almost never start trying to fix errors from the end of the file to the
beginning for one simple reason: you don't know if they're actually errors!

<br><br> 
A single error near the top of your program can cause a cascade of other
compiler errors because those lines might rely on something early in the
program that the compiler couldn't understand.  For instance, if you declare a
variable with improper syntax, the compiler will complain about that syntax
error <em>and</em> that it cannot find a declaration for the variable.  Leaving
off a semicolon in the wrong place can result in an astonishing number of
errors.  Things like this can happen because C and C++ syntax allows for things
like declaring of a type immediately after the type definition:

<pre class="example">
struct 
{
        int x;
        int y;
} myStruct;
</pre>

This would create a variable, myStruct, with room to store a struct containing
two integers.  Unfortunately, this means that if you leave off a semicolon, the
compiler will interpret it as though the next thing in the program is intended
to be a struct (or return a struct).  Something like this

<pre class="example">
struct MyStructType
{
        int x;
        int y;
}

int foo()
{}
</pre>

can result in an surprising number of errors (possibly including a complaint
about an extraneous "int" being ignored).  All this for a single character!
best to start at the top.

<h2>Dissecting an Error Message</h2>

Most messages from the compiler will consist of at least four things: the type
of message--warning or error--source code file in which the error appeared, and
the line of the error, and a brief description of what was wrong.  Output from
g++ for the above program might look something like this (your results with
other compilers may vary):

<pre class="example">
foo.cc:7: error: semicolon missing after struct declaration
</pre>

foo.cc is the name of the file.  7 is the line number in question, and it is
clear that this is an error.  The brief message here is quite helpful because
it says exactly what was wrong.  Notice, however, that the message makes sense
only in the context of the program.  It doesn't say which struct was missing a
semicolon.  
<br><br> 

More cryptic was another error message from the same compilation attempt:
"extraneous 'int' ignored".  It's up to the programmer to figure out exactly
why it was extraneous.  Notice again that this was an error caused by a problem
earlier in the program, not on line 8, but earlier, when the struct lacked a
semicolon terminator.  Fortunately, it's pretty clear that the function
definition for foo was OK; this tells us that the error must have been caused
somewhere else in the program.  In fact, it had to be earlier in the
program--you won't get an error message that indicates a syntax error prior to
the line on which the error actually occurred.
<br><br> 

This brings up another guiding principle of hunting down compiler errors: when
in doubt, <b>look earlier in the program</b>.  Since syntax errors can have
mysterious repercussions later, it's possible that the compiler was giving a
line number that doesn't actually have a syntax error!  Worse, many times, the
compiler won't be as friendly in telling you exactly what happened earlier in
the program.  Even the first compiler error you get might be due to something
several lines before the indicated warning.

<h2>Handling Cryptic or Bizarre Messages</h2>

There are several types of compiler errors that are especially frustrating.
The first is the case of an undeclared variable that you swear you declared.
Often times, you can actually point out exactly where the variable was
declared!  The problem is often that the variable is simply misspelled.
Unfortunately, this can be very hard to see since the mind typically reads what
it expects rather than what is actually there.  Worse, there are other reasons
why this could be a problem too--scoping issues for instance!

<br><br>
To sort through the possible problems, one trick I like to use is to go to the
line of the supposedly undeclared variable and have my text editor perform a
search for the word under the cursor (alternatively, you could copy the
variable name and perform a search); this guarantees that if I spelled it
incorrectly, it will not find a match for my search.  This also keeps me from
having to type the word, which could result in my correctly spelling the
variable name. 

<br><br> 
A second cryptic message is the "unexpected end of file".  What's going on
here?  Why would the end of the file be "unexpected"?  Well, the key here is to
think like the compiler; if the end of the file is unexpected, then it must be
that it's waiting for something.  What could it be waiting for?  The answer is
usually "closure".  For instance, closing curly braces or closing quotes.  A
good <a href="../texteditors.html">text editor</a> that
performs syntax highlighting and automatic indentation should help fix some of
these issues by making it easier to spot problems when writing code.

<br><br> 
Ultimately, when a message is cryptic, the way to approach the problem is to
think about how the compiler is trying to interpret the file.  This can be hard
when you're just starting out, but if you pay attention to the messages and try
to pick out what they could mean, you'll quickly get used to the general
patterns.

<br><br>
Finally, if nothing else works, you can always just rewrite a few
lines of code to clear out any hidden syntax errors that might be hard for the
eye to catch.  This can be dangerous if you don't end up rewriting the right
section of code, but it can be helpful. 

<h2>Linker Errors</h2>

Once you've finally cleaned up all those frustrating syntax errors, taken a
nap, had a meal or two, and mentally prepared yourself for the program to build
correctly, you may still need to deal with linker errors.  These can often be
more frustrating because they aren't necessarily the result of something
written in your program.  I'll briefly cover some of the typical types of
linker errors you can expect and some of the ways to fix them.

<br><br>
You may have issues with how you set up your compiler.  For
instance, even if you include the correct header files for all of your
functions, you still need to provide your linker with the correct path to the
library that has the actual implementation.  Otherwise, you will get "undefined
function" error messages.  Be careful that your compiler doesn't actually
support these functions at all (this could happen if you include your own
declaration of a function to get around a compile-time error).  If your
compiler should support the function, then fixing this problem usually requires
compiler-specific settings.  You'll generally want to look for how to tell the
compiler where to look for libraries and make sure that the libraries were actually installed correctly. 

<br><br>
Linker errors can also come about in functions that you have declared
and defined if you fail to include all of the necessary object files in the
linking process.  For example, if you write your class definition in
myClass.cc, and your main function is in myMain.cc, your compiler will create
two object files, myClass.o and myMain.o, and the linker will need both of them
to finish the creation of the new program.  If you leave out myClass.o, then it
will not have the class definition even if you correctly included myClass.h!

<br><br>
A sometimes subtle error is when the linker complains about there being more
than one definition for a class, function, or variable.  This issue can come up
in one of several ways: first, there might actually be two definitions of an
object--for instance, two global variables both declared as external variables
to be accessible outside of the source code file.  This is a legitimate concern
for both functions and variables, and it definitely can happen.  On the
other hand, sometimes the problem is with the directives to the linker; on more
than one occasion, I've seen people include multiple copies of the same object file in the linking process.  And bingo, you've got multiple definitions.  A typical giveaway for this problem is that a whole host of functions have multiple definitions.

<br><br>
 The last bizarre type of linker error is a complain about an
"undefined reference to main".  This particular linker error differs from the
other in that it may have nothing to do with including object files or having
the correct paths to your libraries.  Instead, it means that the linker tried
to create an executable and couldn't figure out where the main() function was
located.  This can happen if you forget to include the main function at all, or if you attempt to compile code that was never meant to be a stand-alone executable (for instance, if you tried to compile a library).
