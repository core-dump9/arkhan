Generally, as a programmer you don't need to concern yourself about operations
at the bit level.  You're free to think in bytes, or ints and doubles, or even
higher level data types composed of a combination of these.  But there are
times when you'd like to be able to go to the level of an individual bit.
<a href="xor.html">Exclusive-or encryption</a> is one example when you need bitwise operations.

  <br><br>
Another example comes up when dealing with data compression: what if you
wanted to compress a file?  In principle, this means taking one representation
and turning it into a representation that takes less space.  One way of doing
this is to use an encoding that takes less than 8 bits to store a byte.  (For
instance, if you knew that you would only be using the 26 letters of the Roman
alphabet and didn't care about capitalization, you'd only need 5 bits to do
it.)  In order to encode and decode files compressed in this manner, you need
to actually extract data at the bit level.

<br><br>
Finally, you can use bit operations to speed up your program or perform neat
tricks.  (This isn't always the best thing to do.)

<h2>Thinking about Bits</h2>

The byte is the lowest level at which we can access data; there's no "bit" type, and we
can't ask for an individual bit.  In fact, we can't even perform operations on
a single bit -- every bitwise operator will be applied to, at a minimum,
an entire byte at a time.  This means we'll be considering the whole
representation of a number whenever we talk about applying a bitwise operator.
(Note that this doesn't mean we can't ever change only one bit at a time; it
just means we have to be smart about how we do it.) Understanding what it
means to apply a bitwise operator to an entire string of bits is probably
easiest to see with the shifting operators.  By convention, in C and C++ you
can think about binary numbers as starting with the most significant bit to
the left (i.e., 10000000 is 128, and 00000001 is 1).  Regardless of underlying
representation, you may treat this as true.  As a consequence, the results of
the left and right shift operators are not implementation dependent for
unsigned numbers (for signed numbers, the right shift operator is
implementation defined). 

<br><br>
The leftshift operator is the equivalent of moving all the bits of a number a
specified number of places to the left:

<pre class="example">
[variable]&lt;&lt;[number of places]
</pre>
For instance, consider the number 8 written in binary 00001000.  If we wanted
to shift it to the left 2 places, we'd end up with 00100000; everything is
moved to the left two places, and zeros are added as padding.  This is the
number 32 -- in fact, left shifting is the equivalent of multiplying by a
power of two.
<pre class="example">
int mult_by_pow_2(int number, int power)
{
    return number&lt;&lt;power;
}
</pre>
Note that in this example, we're using integers, which are either 2 or 4
bytes, and that the operation gets applied to the entire sequence of 16 or 32
bits.

<br><br>
But what happens if we shift a number like 128 and we're only storing it in a
single byte: 10000000?  Well, 128 * 2 = 256, and we can't even store a number
that big in a byte, so it shouldn't be surprising that the result is 00000000.

<br><br>
It shouldn't surprise you that there's a corresponding right-shift operator:
&gt;&gt; (especially considering that I mentioned it earlier).  Note that a
bitwise right-shift will be the equivalent of integer division by 2.

<br><br>
Why is it integer division?  Consider the number 5, in binary, 00000101.  5/2
is 2.5, but if you are performing integer division, 5/2 is 2.  When you
perform a right shift by one: (unsigned int)5&gt;&gt;1, you end up with 00000010, as the
rightmost 1 gets shifted off the end; this is the representation of the number
2.  Note that this only holds true for unsigned integers; otherwise, we are
not guaranteed that the padding bits will be all 0s. 

<br><br>
Generally, using the left and right shift operators will result in
significantly faster code than calculating and then multiplying by a power of
two.  The shift operators will also be useful later when we look at how to
manipulating individual bits.

<br><br>
For now, let's look at some of the other binary operators to see what they can
do for us.

<h2>Bitwise AND</h2>

The bitwise AND operator is a single ampersand: &amp;.  A handy mnemonic is
that the small version of the boolean AND, &amp;&amp;, works on smaller pieces
(bits instead of bytes, chars, integers, etc).  In essence, a binary AND
simply takes the logical AND of the bits in each position of a number in
binary form.

<br><br>
For instance, working with a byte (the char type):
<pre class="example">
01001000 &amp; 
10111000 = 
--------
00001000
</pre>

The most significant bit of the first number is 0, so we know the most
significant bit of the result must be 0; in the second most significant bit,
the bit of second number is zero, so we have the same result.  The only time
where both bits are 1, which is the only time the result will be 1, is the
fifth bit from the left.  Consequently, 
<pre class="example">
72 &amp; 184 = 8
</pre>

<h2>Bitwise OR</h2>

Bitwise OR works almost exactly the same way as bitwise AND.  The only
difference is that only one  of the two bits needs to be a 1 for that
position's bit in the result to be 1.  (If both bits are a 1, the result will
also have a 1 in that position.)  The symbol is a pipe: |.  Again, this is
similar to boolean logical operator, which is ||.
<pre class="example">
01001000 | 
10111000 = 
--------
11111000
</pre>
and consequently
<pre class="example">
72 | 184 = 248
</pre>

Let's take a look at an example of when you could use just these four
operators to do something potentially useful.  Let's say that you wanted to
keep track of certain boolean attributes about something -- for instance, you
might have eight cars (!) and want to keep track of which are in use.  Let's
assign each of the cars a number from 0 to 7.

<br><br>
Since we have eight items, all we really need is a single byte, and we'll use
each of its eight bits to indicate whether or not a car is in use.  To do
this, we'll declare a char called in_use, and set it to zero.  (We'll assume
that none of the cars are initially "in use".)

<pre class="example">
char in_use = 0;
</pre>

Now, how can we check to make sure that a particular car is free before we try
to use it?  Well, we need to isolate the one bit that corresponds to that car.
The strategy is simple: use bitwise operators to ensure every bit of the
result is zero except, possibly, for the bit we want to extract.

<br><br>
Consider trying to extract the fifth bit from the right of a number: XX?XXXXX
We want to know what the question mark is, and we aren't concerned about the
Xs.  We'd like to be sure that the X bits don't interfere with our result, so
we probably need to use a bitwise AND of some kind to make sure they are all
zeros.  What about the question mark?  If it's a 1, and we take the bitwise
AND of XX?XXXXX and 00100000, then the result will be 00100000:

<pre class="example">
XX1XXXXX &amp; 
00100000 = 
--------
00100000
</pre>

Whereas, if it's a zero, then the result will be 00000000:
<pre class="example">
XX0XXXXX &amp; 
00100000 = 
--------
00000000
</pre>

So we get a non-zero number if, and only if, the bit we're interested in is a
1.

<br><br>
This procedure works for finding the bit in the nth position.  The only thing
left to do is to create a number with only the one bit in the correct position
turned on.  These are just powers of two, so one approach might be to do
something like:

<pre class="example">
int is_in_use(int car_num)
{
    // pow returns an int, but in_use will also be promoted to an int
    // so it doesn't have any effect; we can think of this as an operation
    // between chars
    return in_use &amp; pow(2, car_num);
}
</pre>
While this function works, it can be confusing.  It obscures the fact that
what we want to do is shift a bit over a certain number of places, so that we
have a number like 00100000 -- a couple of zeros, a one, and some more zeros.
(The one could also be first or last -- 10000000 or 00000001.)

<br><br>
We can use a bitwise leftshift to accomplish this, and it'll be much faster to
boot.  If we start with the number 1, we are guaranteed to have only a single
bit, and we know it's to the far-right.  We'll keep in mind that car 0 will
have its data stored in the rightmost bit, and car 7 will be the leftmost.
<pre class="example">
int is_in_use(int car_num)
{
    return in_use &amp; 1&lt;&lt;car_num;
}
</pre>

Note that shifting by zero places is a legal operation -- we'll just get back
the same number we started with.

<br><br>
All we can do right now is check whether a car is in use; we can't
actually set the in-use bit for it.  There are two cases to consider:
indicating a car is in use, and removing a car from use.  In one case, we need
to turn a bit on, and in the other, turn a bit off.  

<br><br>
Let's tackle the problem of turning the bit on.  What does this suggest we
should do?  If we have a bit set to zero, the only way we know right now to
set it to 1 is to do a bitwise OR.  Conveniently, if we perform a bitwise OR
with only a single bit set to 1 (the rest are 0), then we won't affect the
rest of the number because anything ORed with zero remains the same (1 OR 0 is
1, and 0 OR 0 is 0).

<br><br>
Again we need to move a single bit into the correct position:
<pre class="example">
void set_in_use(int car_num)
{
    in_use = in_use | 1&lt;&lt;car_num;
}
</pre>

What does this do?  Take the case of setting the rightmost bit to 1: we have
some number 0XXXXXXX | 10000000; the result, 1XXXXXXX.  The shift is the same
as before; the only difference is the operator and that we store the result.

<br><br>
Setting a car to be no longer in use is a bit more complicated.  For that,
we'll need another operator.

<h2>The Bitwise Complement</h2>


The bitwise complement operator, the tilde, ~, flips every bit.  A useful way
to remember this is that the tilde is sometimes called a twiddle, and the
bitwise complement twiddles every bit: if you have a 1, it's a 0, and if you
have a 0, it's a 1.

<br><br>
This turns out to be a great way of finding the largest possible value for an
unsigned number:

<pre class="example">
unsigned int max = ~0;
</pre>

0, of course, is all 0s: 00000000 00000000.  Once we twiddle 0, we get all 1s:
11111111 11111111.  Since max is an unsigned int, we don't have to worry about
sign bits or twos complement.  We know that all 1s is the largest possible
number.

<br><br>
Note that ~ and ! cannot be used interchangeably.  When you take the logical
NOT of a non-zero number, you get 0 (FALSE).  However, when you twiddle a
non-zero number, the only time you'll get 0 is when every bit is turned on.
(This non-equivalence principle holds true for bitwise AND too, unless you
know that you are using strictly the numbers 1 and 0.  For bitwise OR, to be
certain that it would be equivalent, you'd need to make sure that the
underlying representation of 0 is all zeros to use it interchangeably.  But
don't do that!  It'll make your code harder to understand.)

<br><br>
Now that we have a way of flipping bits, we can start thinking about how to
turn off a single bit.  We know that we want to leave other bits unaffected,
but that if we have a 1 in the given position, we want it to be a 0.  Take some time to think about how to do this before reading further.

<br><br>
We need to come up with a sequence of operations that leaves 1s and 0s in the
non-target position unaffected; before, we used a bitwise OR, but we can also
use a bitwise AND.  1 AND 1 is 1, and 0 AND 1 is 0.  Now, to turn off a bit,
we just need to AND it with 0: 1 AND 0 is 0.  So if we want to indicate that car 2 is no longer in use, we want to take the bitwise AND of XXXXX1XX with 11111011.

<br><br>
How can we get that number?  This is where the ability to take the complement
of a number comes in handy: we already know how to turn a single bit on.  If
we turn one bit on and take the complement of the number, we get every bit on
except that bit:

<pre class="example">
~(1&lt;&lt;position)
</pre>

Now that we have this, we can just take the bitwise AND of this with the
current field of cars, and the only bit we'll change is the one of the car_num
we're interested in.

<pre class="example">
int set_unused(int car_num)
{
    in_use = in_use &amp; ~(1&lt;&lt;position);
}
</pre>

You might be thinking to yourself, but this is kind of clunky.  We actually
need to know whether a car is in use or not (if the bit is on or off) before we can
know which function to call.  While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it
means that we do need to know a little bit about what's going on.  There is an
easier way, but first we need the last bitwise operator: exclusive-or.

<h2>Bitwise Exclusive-Or (XOR)</h2>

There is no boolean operator counterpart to bitwise exclusive-or, but there is
a simple explanation.  The exclusive-or operation takes two inputs and
returns a 1 if either one or the other of the inputs is a 1, but not if both
are.  That is, if both inputs are 1 or both inputs are 0, it returns 0.
Bitwise exclusive-or, with the operator of a carrot, ^, performs the
exclusive-or operation on each pair of bits.  Exclusive-or is commonly
abbreviated XOR.

<br><br>
For instance, if you have two numbers represented in binary as 10101010 and
01110010 then taking the bitwise XOR results in 11011000.  It's easier to see
this if the bits are lined up correctly:
<pre class="example">
01110010 ^
10101010 
--------
11011000
</pre>

You can think of XOR in the following way: you have some bit, either 1 or 0,
that we'll call A.  When you take A XOR 0, then you always get A back: if A is
1, you get 1, and if A is 0, you get 0.  On the other hand, when you take A
XOR 1, you flip A.  If A is 0, you get 1; if A is 1, you get 0.  

<br><br>
So you can think of the XOR operation as a sort of selective twiddle: if you
apply XOR to two numbers, one of which is all 1s, you get the equivalent of a
twiddle.  

<br><br>
Additionally, if you apply the XOR operation twice -- say you have a bit, A,
and another bit B, and you set C equal to A XOR B, and then take C XOR B: you
get A XOR B XOR B, which essentially either flips every bit of A twice, or
never flips the bit, so you just get back A.  (You can also think of B XOR B
as cancelling out.)  As an exercise, can you think of a way to use this to
exchange two integer variables without a temporary variable?  (Once you've
figured it out, check the <a href="xorsol.html">solution</a>.)

<br><br>
How does that help us?  Well, remember the first principle: XORing a bit with
0 results in the same bit.  So what we'd really like to be able to do is just
call one function that flips the bit of the car we're interested in -- it
doesn't matter if it's being turned on or turned off -- and leaves the rest of
the bits unchanged.

<br><br>
This sounds an awful lot like the what we've done in the past; in fact, we
only need to make one change to our function to turn a bit on.  Instead of
using a bitwise OR, we use a bitwise XOR.  This leaves everything unchanged,
but flips the bit instead of always turning it on:

<pre class="example">
void flip_use_state(int car_num)
{
    in_use = in_use ^ 1&lt;&lt;car_num;
}
</pre>

<h2>When should you use bitwise operators?</h2>

Bitwise operators are good for saving space -- but many times, space is hardly
an issue.  And one problem with working at the level of the individual bits is
that if you decide you need more space or want to save some time -- for
instance, if we needed to store information about 9 cars instead of 8 -- then
you might have to redesign large portions of your program.  On the other hand,
sometimes you can use bitwise operators to cleverly remove dependencies, such
as by using ~0 to find the largest possible integer.  And bit shifting to
multiply by two is a fairly common operation, so it doesn't affect readability
in the way that advanced use of bit manipulation can in some cases (for
instance, using XOR to switch the values stored in two variables).

<br><br>
There are also times when you need to use bitwise operators: if you're working
with compression or some forms of encryption, or if you're working on a system
that expects bit fields to be used to store boolean attributes.

<h2>Summary</h2>

You should now be familiar with six bitwise operators:
<br><br><b>Works on bits for left argument, takes an integer as a second argument</b>

<pre class="example">
bit_arg&lt;&lt;shift_arg
</pre>
Shifts bits to of bit_arg shift_arg places to the left -- equivalent to
multiplication by 2^shift_arg

<pre class="example">
bit_arg&gt;&gt;shift_arg
</pre>
Shifts bits to of bit_arg shift_arg places to the right -- equivalent to
integer division by 2^shift_arg
<br><br><b>Works on the bits of both arguments</b>
<pre class="example">
left_arg &amp; right_arg
</pre>
Takes the bitwise AND of left_arg and right_arg
<pre class="example">
left_arg ^ right_arg
</pre>
Takes the bitwise XOR of left_arg and right_arg

<pre class="example">
left_arg | right_arg
</pre>

<b>Works on the bits of only argument</b>
<pre class="example">
~arg
</pre>
Reverses the bits of arg

<br><br><b>Skills and knowledge</b>
You also know a couple of neat tricks that you can use when performance is
critical, or space is slow, or you just need to isolate and manipulate
individual bits of a number.<br><br>
And you now should have a better sense of what goes on at the lowest levels
of your computer.

<h2>A Parting Puzzle</h2>

One final neat trick of bitwise operators is that you can use them, in
conjunction with a bit of math, to find out whether an integer is a power of two.
