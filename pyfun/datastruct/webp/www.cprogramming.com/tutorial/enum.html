<h1>Enumerated Types - enums</h1>

<div style="margin-right: 1em; float:left; padding: .4em; border-right: 1px solid #bbb"><img src=http://static.cprogramming.com/main_images/alex-50-50.jpg height="50" width="50" border=0 style="padding: 0.25em;"><br><a href=https://plus.google.com/113987539774523532573?rel=author> By Alex Allain</a></div>

Sometimes as programmers we want to express the idea that a variable will be
used for a specific purpose and should only be able to have a small number of
values--for instance, a variable that stores the current direction of the wind
might only need to store values corresponding to north, south, east, and west.
One solution to this problem might be to use an int and some #define'd values:

<pre class="example">
#define NORTH_WIND        0
#define SOUTH_WIND        1
#define EAST_WIND         2
#define WEST_WIND         3     
#define NO_WIND           4       

int wind_direction = NO_WIND;
</pre>

<center>
<div class='noprint'>
<!-- RunOfSite_LargeRectangle_ATF_336x280 -->
<script type='text/javascript'>
GA_googleFillSlot('RunOfSite_LargeRectangle_ATF_336x280');
</script>
</div>


</center>
<br><br>

The problem with this approach is that it doesn't really prevent someone from
assigning a nonsensical value to wind_direction; for instance, I could set
wind_direction to 453 without any complaints from my compiler.  And if I looked
at the type of wind_direction, i would see that it's just a plain old integer.
there's just no way to know that something is wrong.

<br><br>
The idea behind enumerated types is to create new data types that can take on
only a restricted range of values.  Moreover, these values are all expressed as
constants rather than magic numbers--in fact, there should be no need to know
the underlying values.  The names of the constants should be sufficient for the
purposes of comparing values.

<br><br> 
When you declare an enumerated type, you specify the name of the new
type, and the possible values it can take on:

<pre class="example">
enum wind_directions_t {NO_WIND, NORTH_WIND, SOUTH_WIND, EAST_WIND, WEST_WIND};
</pre>

Note the _t at the end of the name of the type: this stands for "type" and is a
way to visually distinguish the name of the type from the name of variables.
Your <a href="../texteditors.html">text editor</a> may
also have the ability to use syntax highlighting to make the new type look like
other built-in types, such as int, for you.   

<br><br>
Now we can declare a wind_directions_t variable that can only take on five values:

<pre class="example">
wind_directions_t wind_direction = NO_WIND;

wind_direction = 453; // doesn't work, we get a compiler error!
</pre>

<b>Note to C Programmers</b>: If you're planning on using enums in C, however,
you don't get this type safety.  The above assignment will compile without
giving you an error.  By the way, if you're using enums in C, you will also need
to prefix the declaration with the keyword enum: enum wind_directions_t
wind_direction = NO_WIND;

<br><br>

You might be wondering exactly what values the constants take on--what if you
wanted to compare then using &lt; or &gt;?  You actually have a choice: if you
want to set the values yourself, you may, or you can choose to use default
values, which start at zero for the first constant and increase by one.  In our
example, NO_WIND has the value 0, and WEST_WIND has the value 4 (just like our
#define'd constants).

<br><br>
On the other hand, we could reverse this by giving explicit values:

<pre class="example">
enum wind_directions_t {NO_WIND = 4, NORTH_WIND = 3, SOUTH_WIND = 2, EAST_WIND = 1, WEST_WIND = 0};
</pre>

Why would you ever want to give explicit values to elements of an enumerated
type?  Isn't the whole point of constants so that you don't need to know what
the values are?  The answer is that if the values of the constant are never used
outside of comparisons between elements of the enumeration, then there's almost
no reason to define the values to be anything in particular (one exception is if
you want one value to have multiple names, you'd have to set at least one value
explicitly).  But if you need the values for communicating with the outside
world, you might need to give specific values.  For example, if you decided to
use an enum to store all of the possible text colors you could pass into a
function to set the text colors, you'd probably need to make sure that the enum
names, such a RED or BLUE, matched up to the values corresponding to those
colors. 

<h2>Printing Enums</h2>
You might wonder what happens when you print out an enum: by default, you'll get the integer value of the enum.  If you want to do something fancier than that, you'll have to handle it specially.

<h2>Naming Enums</h2>

One issue with enums is that the name of the enumerated type doesn't show up
along with the enum.  When you use the enum constant, it could really mean
anything.  The problem is that if you give your enums names that are too
general, you can run into problems.  First, it becomes hard to tell which
enumeration a constant belongs to if you have several enumerated lists of
values.   A related problem is that sometimes you really want to use the same
name.  For instance, what if you had two color schemes, each of which included
the color red, but for which the value of the RED constant needed to be
different?  

<br><br>
The solution to both of these problems is to include part of the name of the
enum in the names of the constants.   Notice that in the above example, I
included "WIND" in the name of each enumerated constant.  (Perhaps this wasn't
entirely necessary--why not just have an enum for each ordinal direction?  The
answer is that it depends on whether someone else is already using the name.
In this case, we avoid the problem by making the names specific enough that
it's unlikely someone else will have a WEST_WIND constant.

<h2>Type Correctness</h2>

Because enums are "integer-like" types, they can safely be assigned into an
integer without a cast.  For instance, both of the following assignments are
totally valid:

<pre class="example">
int my_wind = EAST_WIND;
</pre>

or 

<pre class="example">
wind_directions_t wind_direction = NO_WIND;

int my_wind = wind_direction;
</pre>

As already mentioned, you can't make the reverse assignment in C++ without
using a <a href="lesson14.html">typecast</a>.  There might be times when you do need to do this, but you'd
like to avoid it as best you can.  For instance, if you need to convert a user's input into an enumerated type, it would be a bad idea to just typecast the variable to an int:

<pre class="example">
wind_directions_t wind_direction = NO_WIND;

std::cin &gt;&gt; static_cast<int>( wind_direction );
</int></pre>

This would let the user input any value at all and, almost as bad, force the user to know the range of values that the enum could take on.  A much better solution would be to shield the user from the enumeration by asking for a string and then validating the input by comparing it to the possible input strings to choose which constant to assign the enum.  For instance,

<pre class="example">
std::cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, or NONE for our wind direction";
std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;

string input_wind_dir;
cin &gt;&gt;

wind_directions_t wind_dir;

if ( user_wind_dir == "NORTH" )
{
        wind_dir = NORTH_WIND;
}
else if ( user_wind_dir == "SOUTH" )
{
        wind_dir = SOUTH_WIND;
}
else if ( user_wind_dir == "EAST" )
{
        wind_dir = EAST_WIND;
}
else if ( user_wind_dir == "WEST" )
{
        wind_dir = WEST_WIND;
}
else if ( user_wind_dir == "NONE" )
{
        wind_dir = NO_WIND;
}
else
{
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "That's not a valid direction!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>

<h2>Polymorphic Enums?</h2>

In C++, we often use polymorphism to allow old code to handle new code--for
instance, as long as we subclass the interface expected by a function, we can
pass in the new class and expect it to work correctly with the code that was
written before the new class ever existed.  Unfortunately, with enums, you
can't really do this, even though there are occasional times you'd like to.
(For instance, if you were managing the settings for your program and you
stored all of them as enum values, then it might be nice to have an enum,
settings_t, from which all of your other enums inherited so that you could
store every new enum in the settings list.  Note that since the list contains values of different types, you can't use <a href="floating_point/understanding_floating_point.html">templates</a>.)

<br><br>
If you need this kind of behavior, you're forced to store the enums as integers and then retrieve them using typecasts to assign the particular value to the setting of interest.  And you won't even get the benefit of dynamic_cast to help you ensure that the cast is safe--you'll have to rely on the fact that incorrect values cannot be stored in the list. 

<h2>Summary</h2>

<h3>The Good</h3>

<ul>
<li>Enums allow you to constrain the values a variable takes on
</li>
<li>Enums can be used to make your program more readable by eliminating magic numbers are specifying exact what range of values a variable expects to take on
</li>
<li>Enums can be used to quickly declare a range of constant values without using #define
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>Enum constants must be carefully named to avoid name collisions
</li>
<li>Enums don't work "polymorphically" except from the int type, which can be inconvenient
</li>
</ul>
