<h1>Writing Secure Code</h1>

<div style="margin-right: 1em; float:left; padding: .4em; border-right: 1px solid #bbb"><img src=http://static.cprogramming.com/main_images/alex-50-50.jpg height="50" width="50" border=0 style="padding: 0.25em;"><br><a href=https://plus.google.com/113987539774523532573?rel=author> By Alex Allain</a></div>

Writing secure code is a big deal.  There are a lot of viruses in the world,
and a lot of them rely on exploits in poorly coded programs.  Sometimes the
solution is just to use a safer language -- Java, for instance -- that
typically runs code in a protected environment (for instance, the Java Virtual
Machine).  But this isn't always the best option -- if you need top performance, for example, 
or if you're working on legacy code written in C or C++.  And you need to be
aware of the issues involved in writing unexploitable code.
<br><br>
Two common attacks are buffer overflows and the double free attack.  Since I'm
not out to write a how-to on cracking security, I won't cover the details of exploiting
these attacks any more than you need to know to avoid them.  Instead, I'll
talk about practices you can use to prevent them.

<h2>Buffer Overflows - Smashing the Stack</h2>

A buffer overflow occurs when you allow the user to enter more data than your
program was expecting, thereby allowing arbitrary modifications to memory.
Due to the way the stack is set up, an attacker can write arbitrary code into
memory.  This is how the Morris Worm worked, and it's how thousands of
exploits since have worked.
<br><br>
When functions are called, both the memory to store the variables declared in the function and the memory to store the arguments to the function are pushed
onto the stack as part of a "stack frame".
<br><br>
Here is a rough picture of what the stack frame would look like for a function
call: 
<pre class="example">
[memory for variables in the function][FP][ret][function arguments]
</pre>

First, memory is allocated for variables declared in the function.  Then the
frame pointer, FP, which is used to address variables within the stack frame,
then the address to return to after the function call, ret, followed by the
arguments to the function.
<br><br>
The gist of this attack is that on the stack, for every function call, the ret
pointer indicates where in memory to jump once the function has finished
executing.  In normal execution, this should be back to the calling
function.  However, in some cases, if the program allows overflowing the
buffer stored in the memory allocated for the function, it's possible for an
attacker to set this value to point to an arbitrary region of memory into
which the attacker has written executable code.  (Often, this will actually be
the buffer itself.)

<h2>How can a buffer overflow attack happen?</h2>

When you declare arrays in C or C++, you get a specified amount of memory 
to work with.  This memory, on many systems, is placed before the pointer to the return site (where the function should return to after executing).
<br><br>
For instance, you might declare an array of 100 bytes:

<pre class="example">
char memory[100];
</pre>
This is all well and good.  But what if you really wanted to use 200 bytes?
<br><br>
C will let you:
<pre class="example">

memory[150] = 'a';
</pre>
There aren't bounds checks on the array, and the code might even
work.  (At least in some cases, you'll get a segmentation fault, but this will
depend on whether or not the memory you're accessing belongs to your program
or not.  You might just overwrite other data in your portion of the stack.)
<br><br>
But you know not to just play with memory you haven't asked for, so you
probably won't do things quite like that.  Generally, what happens is that a
function you call will overwrite the memory instead.
<br><br>
You might use a function such as gets() or strcpy that isn't aware of how
much memory you asked for, and consequently, how large an array you have space
for.  This is particularly a problem for standard library functions that work
on NULL-terminated strings such as strcpy, strcat, etc.  Since they rely on
finding a terminating character, if the string being worked with is too long,
they'll happily overwrite the end of the buffer, and if you had declared the
memory as an array, you might end up overwriting data on the stack.  This is
what is referred to as "smashing the stack".
<br><br>
Other dangerous functions include scanf and sprintf for similar reasons as
gets.
<br><br>
What should you use instead?  In place of gets() or using scanf to read in a
string, use fgets()

<pre class="example">
char *fgets(char *buffer, int size, FILE *stream);
</pre>
fgets takes a size -- make this the size of your buffer and it will read in up
to size bytes into buffer from the file pointed to by stream.  So, if you want
to read from standard input (stdin) in order to replace gets:

<pre class="example">
char buffer[10];
fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
</pre>
This will allow the user to input up to 10 bytes for use in buffer.  It will,
however, add a '\0' terminator to buffer.  Doing so would, of course, write
off the end of the array.  This means that you have to add the NULL
terminator manually if you want to use functions such as printf that rely on
it. 
<br><br>
Note that sizeof(buffer) works because buffer is an array; you cannot do the
same thing using a char* that you dynamically allocate using malloc or new.
<br><br>
In place of strcpy or strcat, use the corresponding str<b>n</b>cpy or
str<b>n</b>cat functions that take the length of data to be copied.

<pre class="example">
char *strncpy(char *destination, const char *source, size_t n);
</pre>
Using strncpy will result in at most n bytes being copied from source to
destination, and strncpy will return a pointer to destination.  For instance, if you know that destination can hold only 20
characters:

<pre class="example">
char destination[20];
char *source = "This is a particularly long string";
strncpy(destination, source, sizeof(destination));
</pre>
This will copy only as much of source as can fit in destination and return a
pointer to destination.  You should be aware that strncpy will not
automatically append a null terminator, which means that you can go from a
regular, null-terminated string to a non-null-terminated string if you try to
copy a string that won't fit into the destination.

<pre class="example">
char *strncat(char *destination, const char *source, size_t n);
</pre>
The strncat function copies up to n characters from source onto the end of
destination, starting from the null-terminator character of destination.
Again, if you run out of space in destination before reaching the end of
source, you won't get a null-terminated string back.

And, to replace sprintf, you can use snprintf
<pre class="example">
int snprintf(char *destination, size_t n, const char *format, ...);
</pre>
which will only write a string of n bytes into the memory pointed to by
destination, protecting you from an attacker's writing arbitrary data into your
string when you do something like
<pre class="example">
sprintf(dest, "The user entered: %s", user_input_string);
</pre>
which allows the result stored in dest to be as long as is necessary to store
the user_input_string.
<br><br>
Although we've only looked at examples where the size of memory was allocated
at compile time, and consequently ended up on the stack, similar problems
apply to memory allocated during program execution.  Although I don't know of
a way an attacker would be able to change the flow of control by modifying
memory allocated on the heap, simply by changing variables an attacker could
cause problems (imagine having a username field that your program uses for
access control, and that an attacker can find a way to change that memory).

<h2>Double Free Attack</h2>

Another, more sophisticated attack, is the double free attack that affects
some implementations of malloc.  The attack can happen when you call free on a
pointer that has already been freed before you have re-initialized the pointer
with a new memory address:
<pre class="example">
free(x);
/* code */
free(x);
</pre>
This shouldn't ever need to happen in your code.  The easiest way to avoid it
is simply to set your pointer to point to NULL once you've freed it:
<pre class="example">
free(x); x = NULL;
/* code */
free(x);
</pre>

Since free(NULL) is a valid operation that doesn't do anything, you're safe.
Of course, this doesn't protect you from code that frees memory without
telling you (or without making it obvious that memory is getting freed).  One
way of detecting these types of problems is to use a memory error detector
such Valgrind to ensure that you only execute valid operations.  (Valgrind
will also detect use of initialized memory, use of invalid memory such as is
the case with buffer overflows, and memory leaks.)  Since the double free
problem is one that should show up more or less regardless of user input --
you don't need a malicious attempt to overflow the buffer to test for double
frees -- <a href="../debugging/valgrind.html">Valgrind</a> is a good tool for finding these bugs.  Of course, this
isn't always the case.  For instance, a double free vulnerability in the <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-07.html">zlib library (CERT
Advisory)</a> required a certain type of user input to even cause free to be
called twice on the same memory.
<br><br>
This bug is harder to exploit than potential buffer overflows, and it also
relies on a particular implementation of the memory allocation system.
Nevertheless, it's important to ensure that your code correctly frees only
valid blocks of memory.
