<h1>Huffman Encoding Compression Algorithm</h1>

<div style="margin-right: 1em; float:left; padding: .4em; border-right: 1px solid #bbb"><img src=http://static.cprogramming.com/main_images/alex-50-50.jpg height="50" width="50" border=0 style="padding: 0.25em;"><br><a href=https://plus.google.com/113987539774523532573?rel=author> By Alex Allain</a></div>

The Huffman encoding algorithm is an optimal compression algorithm when only
the frequency of individual letters are used to compress the data.  (There are
better algorithms that can use more structure of the file than just letter
frequencies.)  The idea behind the algorithm is that if you have some letters
that are more frequent than others, it makes sense to use fewer bits to encode
those letters than to encode the less frequent letters.

<br><br>
For instance, take the following phrase: "ADA ATE APPLE".  There are 4 As, 1
D, 1 T, 2 Es, 2 Ps, 1 L, and 2 spaces.  There are a few ways that might be
reasonable ways of encoding this phrase using letter frequencies.  First,
notice that there are only a very few letters that show up here.  It would be
silly to use chars, with eights bits apiece, to encode each character of the
string.  In fact, given that there are only seven characters, we could get
away with using three bits for each character!  If we decided to simply take
that route, that would require using 14 * 3 bits, for a total of 42 bits (and
some extra padding for the sake of having correct bit-alignment since you
have to use an entire byte).  That's not too bad!  It's a lot better than the
8 * 14 = 112 bits that would otherwise be required.

<br><br>
But we can do even better if we consider that if one character shows up
many times, and several characters show up only a few times, then using one
bit to encode one character and many bits to encode another might actually
be useful if the character that uses many bits only shows up a small number of
times!  

<h2>Prefix Property</h2>
To get away with doing this, we now need a way of knowing how to tell which
encoding matches which letter.  For instance, before, we knew that every three
(or eight bits) was a boundary for a letter.  Now, with different length
encodings for different letters, we need to have some way of separating the
words out.  For instance, given the string 001011100, if we know that every
letter is encoded with three bits, it's easy to break apart into 001 011 100.
If some letters are encoded with one bit, and another with four, it's not
as easy to know how to do it.

<br><br>
But we can use a trick commonly referred to as the "prefix property".  The
idea is that the encoding for any one character isn't a prefix for any other
character.  For instance, if A is encoded with 0, then no other character will
be encoded with a zero at the front.  That way, if we start reading a string
of bits and the first bit is a zero, we know that we can stop reading, and
we know that bit encodes an A because <b>no other character encoding begins
with a 0</b>.  In general, the idea is that if we have a full encoding for a
character, then that encoding won't show up at the beginning of the encoding
for any other character.  This means that once we actually read a string of
bits that match a particular character, we know that it must mean that that's
the next character and we can start fresh from the next bit, looking for a new
character encoding match.

<br><br>
Note that it is perfectly fine for the encoding for a character to show up
<i>in the middle</i> of the encoding for another character because there's no
way we'd mistake that as the encoding for another character so long as we
start decoding from the first bit in the compressed file.  (On the other hand,
if we get off by a bit, this might cause some headaches.)

<br><br>
Let's take a look at how this might actually work using some simple encodings
that all have the property that the encoding for one character doesn't show up
at the beginning of the encoding for another character.  

<pre class="example">
char  encoding
A     0
E     10
P     110
space 1110
D     11110
T     111110
L     111111
</pre>

This is a pretty simple encoding, but it does match the prefix property -- the
encoding for A doesn't show up at the front of any other encoding, nor does
the encoding for B, and so forth.  (Some of the encodings share the same
prefix, but that's perfectly fine because we can always tell them apart at
some point by reading in more bits.)

<br><br>
For instance, the original string we had could be encoded by 

<pre class="example">
011110011100111110101110011011011111110 (39 bits)
</pre>

which we could break apart as 
<pre class="example">
0 11110 0 1110  0 111110 10 1110  0 110 110 111111 10
A D     A Space A T      E  Space A P   P   L      E
</pre>

Notice that even using this somewhat simple approach to generating encodings
that satisfy the prefix property, we managed to save 4 bits over the approach
of using 3 bits per character.  With even more unbalanced word frequencies, we
could do even better.

<br><br>
A nice way of visualizing the process of decoding a file compressed with
Huffman encoding is to think about the encoding as a <a href="../lesson18.html">binary tree</a>, where each
leaf node corresponds to a single character.  At each inner node of the tree,
if the next bit is a 0, move to the left node, otherwise move to the right
node.
<br><br>
For instance, the prefix encoding used above would have a binary tree
representation that looks like this -- the X's indicate inner nodes.

<pre class="example">
       X
      / \
     /   \
    A     X
         / \
        /   \
       E     X
            / \
           /   \ 
          P     X
               / \
              /   \
             Space X
                  / \
                 /   \
                D     X
                     / \
                    /   \
                   T     L
</pre>

To decode the string, all we do is follow the links of the tree until we hit a
leaf node.  Once a leaf node is reached, we output the character stored at the
leaf and go back up to the root of the tree.

<h2>The Huffman Algorithm</h2>

So far, we've gone over the basic principles we'll need for the Huffman
algorithm, both for encoding and decoding, but we've had to guess at what
would be the best way of actually encoding the characters.  For our simple
text string, it wasn't too hard to figure out a decent encoding that saved a
few bits.  But in the general case, it might be hard to figure out a good
solution, let alone the best possible solution.  

<br><br>
The Huffman algorithm is a so-called "greedy" approach to solving this problem
in the sense that at each step, the algorithm chooses the best available
option.  It turns out that this is sufficient for finding the best encoding.

<br><br>
The basic idea behind the algorithm is to build the tree bottom-up.  First,
every letter starts off as part of its own tree and the trees are ordered by
the frequency of the letters in the original string.  Then the two
least-frequently used letters are combined into a single tree, and the
frequency of that tree is set to be the combined frequency of the two trees
that it links together.
<br><br>

For instance, if we started out with two characters that showed up once, L and
T, in our sample string, they would be recombined into a new tree that has a
"supernode" that links to both L and T, and has a frequency of 2:

<pre class="example">

   X, 2
   / \
  /   \
 L, 1  T, 1

</pre>

This new tree is reinserted into the list of trees in its sorted position.
The process is then repeated, treating trees with more than one
element the same as any other trees except that their frequencies are the sum
of the frequencies of all of the letters at the leaves.  (This is just the sum
of the left and right children of any node because each node stores the
frequency information about its own children.)  The process completes when all
of the trees have been combined into a single tree -- this tree will describe
a Huffman compression encoding.

<br><br>
Essentially, a tree is built from the bottom up -- we start out with 256 trees
(for an ASCII file) -- and end up with a single tree with 256 leaves along
with 255 internal nodes (one for each merging of two trees, which takes place
255 times).  The tree has a few interesting properties -- the frequencies of
all of the internal nodes combined together will give the total number of bits
needed to write the encoded file (except the header).  This property comes
from the fact that at each internal node, a decision must be made to go left
or right, and each internal node will be reached once for each time a
character beneath it shows up in the text of the document. 
<br><br>
To go from plain text to compressed text, you would have to do a traversal of
the tree and store the path to reach each leaf node as a string of bits (0 for
going left, 1 for going right) and associate that bit with the particular
character at the leaf.  Once this is done, converting a plain text file into a
compressed file is just a matter of replacing each letter with an appropriate
bit string and then handling the possibility of having some extra bits that
need to be written (this is discussed more fully in the implementation notes).

Notice that two different data structures likely need to be used here -- a
list of trees, and those binary trees themselves.  It might make sense to use
several data structures such as:

<pre class="example">
struct tree_t
{
    tree_t *left;
    tree_t *right;
    char character;
};
</pre>
to store the tree elements (note that if left and right are NULL, then we
would know that the node is a leaf and that character stores a valid char of
interest) and

<pre class="example">
struct list_t
{
    list_t *next;
    int total_frequency;
    tree_t *tree;
}
</pre>

to store the list of trees that still need to be merged together as a <a href="../lesson15.html">linked
list</a>.
<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
The first thing to realize is that when writing a compressed file, you will
need to include a Huffman header that stores the letter frequencies in the
original file so that the Huffman tree can be rebuilt by whoever is decoding
the file.  This could be something as simple as 

<pre class="example">
struct huff_header
{
    char letters[256];
};
</pre>

and you could use fread to read in the entire header at once.  It wouldn't
hurt to include a "magic number" at the beginning of your header so that your
program can tell whether the file was actually compressed by your program.
(This prevents the confusion of wondering if the garbage output is a result of
a garbage plain text file, or if the file being decompressed wasn't actually
created from a plain text file.)

<br><br>
When implementing Huffman compression, remember that any one of many possible
encodings may be valid, and the differences come about based on how you build
up the tree.  This means that both the compressor and decompressor will need
to follow the same rules.  In practice, it probably makes sense to use the
same tree building code for both.

<br><br>
Files are written in chunks of eight bits, but it's unlikely that you will
have a file that, when compressed, turns out to need an exact multiple of
eight bits.  You'll have to add some extra junk at the end of the last byte
you write to the file, and when decoding, you'll need some way of knowing when
you've finished reading the valid bits and started reading the bits that were
added as packing (which may or may not encode a character).  One way of doing
this would be to keep track of the number of letters decompressed so far and
stop decoding the file when that limit has been reached.
