<h1>Using Valgrind to Find Memory Leaks and Invalid Memory Use</h1>

<div style="margin-right: 1em; float:left; padding: .4em; border-right: 1px solid #bbb"><img src=http://static.cprogramming.com/main_images/alex-50-50.jpg height="50" width="50" border=0 style="padding: 0.25em;"><br><a href=https://plus.google.com/113987539774523532573?rel=author> By Alex Allain</a></div>

<a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> is a multipurpose code profiling
and memory debugging tool for Linux when on the x86 and, as of version 3,
AMD64, architectures.   It
allows you to run your program in Valgrind's own environment that monitors
memory usage such as calls to malloc and free (or new and delete in C++).  If
you use uninitialized memory, write off the end of an array, or forget to free
a pointer, Valgrind can detect it.  Since these are particularly common
problems, this tutorial will focus mainly on using Valgrind to find these
types of simple memory problems, though Valgrind is a tool that can do a lot
more.  <br><br><center>

  <br><br>
For Windows users: if you don't have access to a Linux machine, or if you want
to develop Windows-specific software, you might be interested in IBM's <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/purify/">Purify</a>, which has
features similar to Valgrind for finding memory leaks and invalid memory
accesses.  A trial download is available.
<br><br><h2>Getting Valgrind</h2>
If you're running Linux and you don't have a copy already, you can get
Valgrind from the <a href="http://valgrind.org/downloads.html">Valgrind
download page</a>.

<br><br>
Installation should be as simple as decompressing and untarring using bzip2
(XYZ is the version number in the below examples)

<pre class="example">
bzip2 -d valgrind-XYZ.tar.bz2
tar -xf valgrind-XYZ.tar
</pre>

which will create a directory called valgrind-XYZ; change into that directory
and run

<pre class="example">
./configure
make
make install
</pre>

Now that you have Valgrind installed, let's look at how to use it.

<h2>Finding Memory Leaks With Valgrind</h2>

Memory leaks are among the most difficult bugs to detect because they don't
cause any outward problems until you've run out of memory and your call to
malloc suddenly fails.  In fact, when working with a language like C or C++
that doesn't have garbage collection, almost half your time might be spent
handling correctly freeing memory.  And even one mistake can be costly if
your program runs for long enough and follows that branch of code.
<br><br>
When you run your code, you'll need to specify the tool you want to use;
simply running valgrind will give you the current list.  We'll focus mainly on
the memcheck tool for this tutorial as running valgrind with the memcheck tool
will allow us to check correct memory usage.  

With no other arguments, Valgrind presents a summary of calls to free and
malloc: (Note that 18490 is the process id on my system; it will differ
between runs.)

<pre class="example">
% valgrind --tool=memcheck program_name
...
=18515== malloc/free: in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
==18515== malloc/free: 1 allocs, 1 frees, 10 bytes allocated.
==18515== For a detailed leak analysis,  rerun with: --leak-check=yes
</pre>

If you have a memory leak, then the number of allocs and the number of frees
will differ (you can't use one free to release the memory belonging to more
than one alloc).  We'll come back to the error summary later, but for now,
notice that some errors might be suppressed -- this is because some errors
will be from standard library routines rather than your own code.

<br><br>
If the number of allocs differs from the number of frees, you'll want to rerun
your program again with the leak-check option.  This will show you all of the
calls to malloc/new/etc that don't have a matching free.

<br><br>
For demonstration purposes, I'll use a really simple program that I'll compile
to the executable called "example1"

<pre class="example">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
{
    char *x = malloc(100); /* or, in C++, "char *x = new char[100] */
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<pre class="example">
% valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes example1
</pre>

This will result in some information about the program showing up, culminating
in a list of calls to malloc that did not have subsequent calls to free:

<pre class="example">
==2116== 100 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==2116==    at 0x1B900DD0: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:131)
==2116==    by 0x804840F: main (in /home/cprogram/example1)
</pre>

This doesn't tell us quite as much as we'd like, though -- we know that the
memory leak was caused by a call to malloc in main, but we don't have the line
number.  The problem is that we didn't compile using the -g option of gcc,
which adds debugging symbols.  So if we recompile with debugging symbols, we
get the following, more useful, output:

<pre class="example">
==2330== 100 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==2330==    at 0x1B900DD0: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:131)
==2330==    by 0x804840F: main (example1.c:5)
</pre>

Now we know the exact line where the lost memory was allocated.  Although it's
still a question of tracking down exactly when you want to free that memory,
at least you know where to start looking.  And since for every call to malloc
or new, you should have a plan for handling the memory, knowing where the
memory is lost will help you figure out where to start looking.

<br><br>
There will be times when the --leak-check=yes option will not result in
showing you all memory leaks.  To find absolutely every unpaired call to free
or new, you'll need to use the --show-reachable=yes option.  Its output is
almost exactly the same, but it will show more unfreed memory.

<h2>Finding Invalid Pointer Use With Valgrind</h2>

Valgrind can also find the use of invalid heap memory using the memcheck tool.
For instance, if you allocate an array with malloc or new and then try to
access a location past the end of the array:

<pre class="example">
char *x = malloc(10);
x[10] = 'a';
</pre>

Valgrind will detect it.  For instance, running the following program,
example2, through Valgrind
<pre class="example">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
    char *x = malloc(10);
    x[10] = 'a';
    return 0;
}
</pre>

with
<pre class="example">
valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes example2
</pre>
results in the following warning
<pre class="example">
==9814==  Invalid write of size 1
==9814==    at 0x804841E: main (example2.c:6)
==9814==  Address 0x1BA3607A is 0 bytes after a block of size 10 alloc'd
==9814==    at 0x1B900DD0: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:131)
==9814==    by 0x804840F: main (example2.c:5)
</pre>

What this tell us is that we're using a pointer allocated room for
10 bytes, outside that range -- consequently, we have an 'Invalid write'.  If
we were to try to read from that memory, we'd be alerted to an 'Invalid read
of size X', where X is the amount of memory we try to read.  (For a char,
it'll be one, and for an int, it would be either 2 or 4, depending on your
system.)

As usual, Valgrind prints the stack trace of function calls so that we know
exactly where the error occurs.

<h2>Detecting The Use Of Uninitialized Variables</h2>

Another type of operation that Valgrind will detect is the use of an
uninitialized value in a conditional statement.  Although you should be in the
habit of initializing all variables that you create, Valgrind will help find
those cases where you don't.  For instance, running the following code as
example3

<pre class="example">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int x;
    if(x == 0)
    {
        printf("X is zero"); /* replace with cout and include 
                                iostream for C++ */
    }
    return 0;
}
</pre>
through Valgrind will result in 
<pre class="example">
==17943== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
==17943==    at 0x804840A: main (example3.c:6)
</pre>

Valgrind is even smart enough to know that if a variable is assigned the value
of an uninitialized variable, that that variable is still in an
"uninitialized" state.  For instance, running the following code:

<pre class="example">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int foo(int x)
{
    if(x &lt; 10)
    {
        printf("x is less than 10\n");
    }
}

int main()
{
    int y;
    foo(y);
}
</pre>

in Valgrind as example4 results in the following warning:

<pre class="example">
==4827== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
==4827==    at 0x8048366: foo (example4.c:5)
==4827==    by 0x8048394: main (example4.c:14)
</pre>

You might think that the problem was in foo, and that the rest of the call
stack probably isn't that important.  But since main passes in an
uninitialized value to foo (we never assign a value to y), it turns out that
that's where we have to start looking and trace back the path of variable
assignments until we find a variable that wasn't initialized.
<br><br>
This will only help you if you actually test that branch of code, and in
particular, that conditional statement.  Make sure to cover all execution
paths during testing!

<h2>What else will Valgrind Find</h2>
Valgrind will detect a few other improper uses of memory: if you call free
twice on the same pointer value, Valgrind will detect this for you; you'll get
an error:
<pre class="example">
Invalid free()
</pre>
along with the corresponding stack trace.

<br><br>

Valgrind also detects improperly chosen methods of freeing memory.  For
instance, in C++ there are three basic options for freeing dynamic memory:
free, delete, and delete[].  The free function should only be matched with a
call to malloc rather than a call to, say, delete -- on some systems, you might be able to get away with not
doing this, but it's not very portable.  Moreover, the delete keyword should only be paired with the new keyword (for allocation of single objects), and the delete[] keyword should only be
paired with the new[] keyword (for allocation of arrays).  (Though some compilers will allow you to get away with using the wrong version of delete,
there's no guarantee that all of them will.  It's just not part of the
standard.)
<br><br>
If you do trigger one of these problems, you'll get this error: 
<pre class="example">
  Mismatched free() / delete / delete []
</pre>
which really should be fixed even if your code happens to be working.
<h2>What Won't Valgrind Find?</h2>

Valgrind doesn't perform bounds checking on static arrays (allocated on the
stack).  So if you declare an array inside your function:

<pre class="example">
int main()
{
    char x[10];
    x[11] = 'a';
}
</pre>

then Valgrind won't alert you!  One possible solution for testing purposes is
simply to change your static arrays into dynamically allocated memory taken
from the heap, where you will get bounds-checking, though this could be a mess
of unfreed memory.
<h2>A Few More Caveats</h2>
What's the drawback of using Valgrind?  It's going to consume more memory --
up to twice as much as your program normally does.  If you're testing an
absolutely huge memory hog, you might have issues.  It's also going to take
longer to run your code when you're using Valgrind to test it.  This shouldn't
be a problem most of the time, and it only affects you during testing.  But if
you're running an already slow program, this might affect you.
<br><br>
Finally, Valgrind isn't going to detect every error you have -- if you don't
test for buffer overflows by using long input strings, Valgrind won't tell you
that your code is capable of writing over memory that it shouldn't be
touching.  Valgrind, like another other tool, needs to be used intelligently
as a way of illuminating problems.
<h2>Summary</h2>
Valgrind is a tool for the x86 and AMD64 architectures and currently runs
under Linux.  Valgrind allows the programmer to run the executable inside its
own environment in which it checks for unpaired calls to malloc and other uses
of
invalid memory (such as ininitialized memory) or invalid memory operations
(such as freeing a block of memory twice or calling the wrong deallocator
function).  Valgrind does not check use of statically allocated arrays.
