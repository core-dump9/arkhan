<h1>Debugging Strategies, Tips, and Gotchas</h1>

Debugging can be tedious and painful if you don't set up your programs to help
you debug them.  In the spirit of "an apple a day keeps the doctor away", this
article suggests approaches to writing code that's more debuggable, how to
catch problems before they start, and gives you some time-wasting gotchas to
watch out for and gives you some gotchas to watch out for.

<h2>Use the Right Tools</h2>

It should go without saying that you should always be using the best tools
available; if you're hunting a <a href="segfaults.html">segmentation
fault</a>, you want use a <a href="../debuggers.html">debugger</a>.  Anything less
than that is unnecessary pain.  If you're dealing with bizarre memory issues
(or hard-to-diagnose segfaults), use <a href="valgrind.html">Valgrind</a> on Linux
or <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/purifyplus/">Purify</a> for
Windows.

<h2>Debug the Problem</h2>

My first instinct when debugging is to ask, "is my code too complicated?"
Sometimes we'll all come up with a solution to a problem only to realize that
the solution is really hard to get working.  So hard, in fact, that it might be
easier to solve the original problem in another way.  When I see someone
struggling to debug a complex mass of code, my first thought is to ask whether
there's a cleaner solution.  Often, once you've written bad code, you have a
much better idea of what the good code should look like.  Remember that just
because you've written it doesn't mean you should keep it!

<br><br>
The trick is always to decide if you're trying to solve the original problem or
to solve a particular choice of solution.  If it's the solution, then it's
possible that your problems don't stem from the problem at all--maybe you're
over-thinking the problem or trying a wrong-headed approach.  For instance, I
recently needed to parse a file and import some of the data into an access
database to prototype an analysis tool.  My first instinct was to write a Ruby
script that interfaced directly with Access and inserted all of the data into
the database using SQL queries.  As I looked at the support for doing this in
Ruby, I quickly realized that my "solution" to the problem was going to take a
lot longer than the problem should have taken.  I reversed course, wrote a
script that just output a comma-separated value file, and had my data fully
imported in about an hour. 

<h3>An Aside on Bad Code</h3>

People are often reluctant to throw out bad code that they've written and
re-write it.  One reason is that code that's written feels like completed work,
and throwing it out feels like going backward.  But when you're debugging,
rewriting the code can seem more appealing because you're probably saving
yourself time spent debugging by spending a bit more time coding.  The trick is
to avoid throwing out the baby with the bath water--remove the bad code, don't
start the whole program over again (unless it's rotten to the core).  Rewrite only the parts that really need it.

<br><br>
Your second draft will probably be both cleaner and less buggy than
the first, and you may avoid issues like having to go back later and rewrite
the code just so that you can figure out how it was supposed to work.

<br><br>
On the other hand, when you're absolutely sure that code that looks horrible is
the right code to use, you'll want to explain your rationale in a <a href="../tutorial/comments.html">comment</a> so someone
(or you) doesn't come back later and hack it apart.

<h2>Minimize Potential Problems by Avoiding Copy-Paste Syndrome</h2>

Nothing is more frustrating than to realize that you're debugging the same
problem multiple times.  Whenever you copy and paste large chunks of code, you
leave yourself open to the unknown demons inhabiting that code.  If you haven't
debugged it yet, odds are that you're going to have to.  And if you forgot that
you copied that code somewhere else, you're probably going to be debugging the
same code more than once.  (There are other reasons to avoid copy-paste
syndrome; even worse than debugging the same code twice is finding the bug in
only one piece of copy-pasted code.)

<br><br>
The best way to avoid copy-paste syndrome is to use functions to encapsulate as
much of your repeat code as possible.  Some things can't easily be avoided in
C++; you're going to write a lot of for loops no matter what you're doing, so
you can't abstract away the whole looping process.  But if you have the same
loop body in multiple places, that might be a sign that it should be pulled
into a separate function.  As a bonus, this makes other future changes to your
code easier and allows you to reuse the function without having to find a chunk
of code to copy. 

<h3>When to Copy Code</h3>

Although copying code is usually dangerous, there are times when it may be the
best choice.  For instance, if you need to make small, irregular tweaks to a
chunk of code, but the bulk of it needs to remain the same, then copying,
pasting, and careful editing might make sense.  By copying the code, you avoid
the chance that you introduce new bugs by mistyping the code.  It should go
without saying that you should have carefully debugged the code you plan to
copy before you do so!  (But I said it, and I'm not even paid by the word.)

<br><br>
The second reason to copy code is when you have long variable names and a bad
text editor.  The best solution is generally to get a better <a href="../texteditors.html">text editor</a> with keyword
completion.

<h2>Make Big Problems Found Late Small Problems Found Early</h2>

<h3>Testing Early</h3>

One advantage of pulling out code and putting it into functions is that you can
then separately test those functions.  This means that you can sometimes avoid
debugging big problems caused by simple bugs in the original functions.  Nothing is more frustrating than writing perfectly correct code given how you
thought a function (or a class) worked, only to find out that it doesn't work
that way.  This kind of unit testing requires some discipline and a good sense
of what can go wrong with your code.

<br><br>
Another advantage of early testing--especially if you write some or all of your
tests up-front, before the code--is that you'll pay more attention to the
specific interface to your class.  If you can't test error handling because
you're using an assert instead of an exception or error code, that might be an
indication that you should be using some form of
error reporting rather than asserts.  (Of course, this won't always be the
case--there are times when you just want to verify that your asserts work
correctly.)  Beyond error-reporting, writing tests is the first time you can
test your code's <a href="../tutorial/class_design.html">interface</a>,
which is often as valuable as testing that the code works.  If the interface to
your class is clunky, or your functions have impossible-to-understand, let
alone remember,
argument lists, it might be time to rethink what you're doing before you write
the underlying code.

<h3>Compiler Warnings</h3>

Many potential bugs can be caught by your compiler.  Some such errors include 
using uninitialized variables, accidentally replacing a check for equality with an
assignment in a conditional, or, in C++, errors related to mixing types such as
pointers and ints.  Since this has been covered before, I suggest checking out
the article <a href="../tutorial/compiler_warnings.html">why you should
pay attention to compiler warnings</a>.

<h2>Printf Lies</h2>

        Because I/O is usually buffered by the operating system, using printfs
in your debugging process is risky.  When possible, use a debugger to figure
out what lines of code are the problem rather than narrowing in on the issue
with code littered by printfs and cout.  (And beware the stray printf that
slips in during debugging and, ahem, slips into the final version.)

                <h3>Flush Output</h3>

Nevertheless, there are times when you actually need to keep
track of some state in a log file--perhaps you simply have too much data that
you need to collect, and you need the data from program start-up to the moment
the bug occurs.  To ensure you collect all of the data, be sure to flush it:
you can use fflush in C, or output an endl in C++.  fflush takes the FILE
pointer you are writing into; for instance, to flush stderr, you would write
fflush( stderr);

<h2>Check Your Helper Functions</h2>

This should be obvious, but it's easy to forget in the heat of the moment:
always verify that your helper functions work, especially when seemingly simple
code is failing.  When possible, isolate each helper function and test it
individually, then test each of its helper functions.  There's nothing more
frustrating than realizing that your original logic was right, but your
assumption about a helper function was wrong.

<h3>When Cause Doesn't Immediately Lead to Effect</h3>

Even if a helper function doesn't seem to be the immediate source of a problem,
its side effects may cause latent problems.  For instance, if you have a
helper function that can return NULL and you pass its output into a library
function dealing with C-strings, you may see the immediate cause as
dereferencing a NULL pointer in strcat, but the real cause was the buggy
function you wrote earlier (or the fact that you didn't check for NULL after
calling it).  


<h3>Remember That Code May Be Used in More Than One Place</h3>

Another problem that can come up when debugging is that you discover the
problem appears to be the result of a particular function call, set a break
point inside that function, and then discover that there are hundreds of calls
to the same function throughout the code.  Or worse, you don't notice this
until wasting hours of time trying to figure out what's going on or thinking
that the reason for the problem is that the function is being called
incorrectly.  (When, in fact, it's being called correctly but with different
arguments than the point at which the bug occurred.)

<br><br>
The most obvious solution is to check the call stack after hitting a break
point or to set the breakpoint right before the call that is actually the
problem.  Unfortunately, this doesn't always help if the same call works
thousands of times but fails on the 1001st call.  Potential solutions include
counting the number of calls to a function and then stepping through that many
breakpoints set inside the function, or using a <a href="../tutorial/statickeyword.html">static variable as a counter</a>.
