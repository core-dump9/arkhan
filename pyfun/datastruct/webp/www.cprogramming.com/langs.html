Today's computer programmer has many languages to choose from, but what's the
difference between them?  What are these languages used for?  How can we categorize them in
useful ways?

<br><br>
These days, programming languages are becoming more and more general and
all-purpose, but they still have their specializations, and each language
has its disadvantages and advantages.
<br><br>
Languages can generally be divided into a few basic types, though many
languages support more than one programming style.  This following list isn't
all inclusive or as fine-grained as possible, but it brings out some of the
basic design decisions behind languages.

<h2>Language Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Procedural</b><br>
    The programming style you're probably used to, procedural languages
    execute a sequence of statements that lead to a result.  In essence, a
    procedural language expresses the procedure to be followed to solve a
    problem.  Procedural languages typically use many variables and have heavy
    use of loops and other elements of "state", which distinguishes them from
    functional programming languages.  Functions in procedural languages may
    modify variables or have other side effects (e.g., printing out
    information) other than the value that the function returns.
    </li>
<li>
<b>Functional</b><br>
    Employing a programming style often contrasted with procedural programming,
    functional programs typically make little use of stored state, often
    eschewing loops in favor of recursive functions.  The primary focus
    of functional programming is on the return values of functions, and side
    effects and other means storing state are strongly discouraged.  For
    instance, in a pure functional language, if a function is called, it is
    expected that the function not modify any global variables or perform any
    output.  It may, however, make recursive calls and change the parameters
    of those calls.  Functional languages are often simpler syntactically and
    make it easier to work on abstract problems, but they can also be "further
    from the machine" in that their programming model makes it hard to
    understand exactly how the code is translated into machine language (which
    can be problematic for system programming).
    </li>
<li>
<b>Object-oriented</b><br>
    Object-oriented programming views the world as a collection of objects
    that have internal data and external means of accessing parts of that
    data.  The goal of object-oriented programming is to think about the
    problem by dividing it into a collection of objects that provide services
    that can be used to solve a particular problem.  One of the main tenets
    of object oriented programming is encapsulation -- that everything an
    object will need should be inside the object.  Object-oriented programming
    also emphasizes reusability through inheritance and the ability to extend
    current implementations without having to change a great deal of code by
    using polymorphism. 
    </li>
<li>
<b>Scripting</b><br>
    Scripting languages are often procedural and may contain elements of
    object-oriented languages, but they fall into their own category because
    they are typically not meant to be full-fledged programming languages with
    support for large system development.  For instance, they may not have
    compile-time type checking or require variable declarations.  Typically,
    scripting languages require little syntax to get started but make it very
    easy to make a mess.
    </li>
<li>
<b>Logic</b><br>
    Logic programming languages allow programmers to make declarative
    statements (possibly in first-order logic: "grass implies green" for
    example) and then allow the computer to reason about the consequences of
    those statements.  In a sense, logic programming is not telling the
    computer how to do something, but placing constraints on what it should
    consider doing.
</li>
</ul>
To call these categories "language types" is really a bit misleading.  It's possible to
program in an object-oriented style in C, or a functional style in a scripting
language.  In truth, most modern languages incorporate features and ideas from
multiple domains, which only serves to increase the richness and usefulness of
these languages.  Nevertheless, most languages do not excel at all styles of
programming.
<h2>The Languages</h2>
<b>C++</b> is well-suited for large projects because it has an object-oriented
structure. People can collaborate on one program by breaking it up into parts
and having a small group or even one individual work on each part.  The
object-oriented structure also allows code to be reused a lot, which can 
cut down development time. C++ is also a fairly efficient
language - although many C programmers will disagree.
<br><br><b>C</b> is a popular language, especially in game programming, because it 
doesn't have the extra packaging of the object-oriented C++. Programmers use 
C because
it makes programs slightly faster and smaller than programs written in C++.
You might wonder, however, whether it's worth giving up the reusability of
C++ to get the small increase in performance with C, especially when C++ can,
where necessary, be written in a C programming style.
<br><br><b>Pascal</b> is primarily a teaching language.  Few industrial programs are
written in Pascal. Pascal tends to use keywords instead of C-style braces and
symbols, so it is a bit easier for beginners to understand than languages like
C++.  Still, not everyone thinks Pascal is just for the schools. Borland, the
huge compiler software company, has been pushing Delphi as an industrial
strength programming language. Delphi is an object-oriented version of Pascal,
and currently, only Borland compilers use it.
<br><br><b>Fortran</b> is a number-crunching program, and it is still used by
scientists because the language allows variables of any size up to the memory
limit of the machine. Fortran is especially convenient for engineers, who have
to mathematically model and compute values to high precision. Fortran,
however, isn't nearly as flexible as C or C++. 
Programming in Fortran is rigid, with
strict rules on whitespace and formatting, which sometimes makes reading
Fortran programs difficult.
<br><br><b>Java</b> is a multi-platform language that is especially useful in
networking.  Of course, the most famous usage of Java is on the web, with Java
applets, but Java is also used to build cross-platform programs that stand
alone.  Since it resembles C++ in syntax and structure, learning Java is
usually quite easy for most C++ programmers. Java offers the advantages provided
by object-oriented programming, such as reusability; on the other hand, it
can be difficult to write highly efficient code in Java, and Swing, its
primary user interface, is notoriously slow.  Nevertheless, Java has increased
in speed in recent years, and version 1.5 offers some new features for
making programming easier. 
<br><br><b>Perl</b> was originally a file management language for Unix, but it has
become well known for its use in CGI programming. CGI (Common Gateway
Interface) is a term for programs that web servers can execute to allow web
pages additional capabilities. Perl is great with regular expression pattern
matching, which is a method for searching text. Perl can be used for databases
and other useful server functions, and it is simple to pick up the
basics if you have experience in any imperative language. Web hosting services
prefer Perl over C++ as a CGI language because the web hosts can inspect Perl
script files, since they're just text files, while C++ is compiled, so it
can't be inspected for potentially dangerous code.  Perl is, however,
notorious for its "write once" style of code -- it's very easy to write Perl
scripts taking advantage of lots of shortcuts that you later cannot
understand.
<br><br><b>PHP</b> is a common language for webpage design that is sometimes used 
as a scripting language in *nix.  PHP is designed for rapid website
development, and as a result contains features that make it easy to link to
databases, generate HTTP headers, and so forth.  As a scripting language, it
contains a relatively simple set of basic components that allow the programmer
to quickly get up to speed, though it does have more sophisticated
object-oriented features.
<br><br><b>LISP</b> is functional language used mostly in computer science research.
LISP is unusual in that it stores (nearly) all data in lists, which are like
arrays, but without index numbers. The syntax for lists is very
simple, making it easy for programmers to implement complex structures.
<br><br><b>Scheme</b> A well-known variant of LISP, Scheme has a slightly simpler
syntax and not quite as many features.  A common joke is that any large project
undertaken in Scheme will result in the reimplementation of most of LISP.
Nevertheless, Scheme is quite popular in academic circles and is the
introductory language of MIT's computer science department (and is taught as
part of Harvard's introductory sequence).  Scheme's simplicity makes it a
good way to get started solving problems instead of worrying about programming
language syntax.
<br><br>
Of course, there are still many, many languages not discussed, a few major
ones being Prolog, Tcl, Python, COBOL, Smalltalk, and C#.   Those are
generally related or similar to the programming languages I have described
above. The take home message is that different programming languages have
their advantages and disadvantages, and picking the appropriate language for
the task is often an important step in the process of developing an
application or program.
