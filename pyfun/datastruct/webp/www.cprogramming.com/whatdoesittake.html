<h1>What does it take to be a programmer?</h1>

Many people want to know if they have what it takes to be a good programmer.
There's no simple, check-these-boxes answer to the question, but there are
some helpful traits that you may have or that you can develop.

<br><br><h2>Do I need to know Math?</h2>
First, though, let me eliminate a myth: some people think that math skills are
important, but I've seen great mathematicians who are mediocre programmers,
and lots of great programmers who are certainly not mathematicians (and
probably never expected to be).

<br><br>
Programming is more of a designer's task--to be a good programmer, having an
<b>eye for style and good design</b> is extremely helpful.  I don't mean the
type of style that governs where you put pieces of syntax (for instance, in C,
there are several places where you can put curly braces to surround blocks of
code, and while there are heated debates about whether

<pre class="example">
if (...) {
}
</pre>
is better than
<pre class="example">
if (...)
{
}
</pre>

these are small points of little consequence as long as you are consistent, a
trait that will eventually come naturally.  What I really mean by style is
that you have to have a good sense for discriminating between "good" and "bad"
approaches to attacking problems. 

<h2>The Importance of Design</h2>
Why, you ask?  When you first sit down to write a program, you probably don't
know exactly what it should do (or how to do it).  If you're disciplined about
it, you'll take some time to plan things out on paper and figure out more or
less what you'd like your program to do.  That's great, but it won't
substitute for having actually used the program and noticed that, yes, it
would be fantastic to add this one little feature here.

<br><br>
The secret is that adding little features can be very hard!  This seems
surprising to someone who's never programmed before: all you need to do is
have it print this one piece of data, or take this one type of input, or, etc
etc.  The problem is that inside the program, the architecture might not be
designed to support that kind of information.  For instance, let's say that
you wanted to move a button from one place to another on a simple graphical
user interface.  If the program has been well-designed, this shouldn't be too
much of a problem, but if it hasn't, well, consider this possibility: the
position of the button is governed by its location in pixels.  All button
locations are hard-coded into the program to allow it to decide which button a
particular mouse click was over.  Now, if you move one button, you may have to
go back and change where every single button is located both in the routine to
draw the buttons and in the routine to accept the input.  This can be quite a
hassle!

<br><br>
Clearly, you want some way of having a notion of button positions that isn't
quite so hard to change.  But if you started out your program and didn't
consider that it would be nice to be able to move the buttons around, bam, you
have to go back and change possibly 20 or more lines of code (say, two for
each button) just to move one of ten buttons.  And if you make a mistake with
one button, you're likely to see unexpected results that whose cause is hard
to discover.

<br><br>
This kind of program design is brittle: it can work at first, but when you
need to change something, it's not flexible.  Each button depends on every
other button and relies on the programmer to make the changes.  A much better
approach would be one in which the position of buttons when they're drawn and
when they're clicked on are linked--changing one wouldn't mean you have to
change the other.

<br><br>
The more willing you are to put in the up-front thinking before designing your
program, the easier you will find the actual writing of code.  This is not to
say that when you're first learning you shouldn't just write some simple
programs without worrying too much about these issues.  But you should be
prepared to pay attention to these things and what problems your first
programs did have.

<h2>The importance of Patience</h2>
The second trait that you need is <b>patience</b>.  At some point in your
programming career, you will certainly make small mistakes that cost you hours
of debugging only to realize that you were misspelling a variable name so the
compiler thought it was another variable.  These things happen even to good
programmers--and the better you get as you practice, the more you find that
your bugs are interesting--but still hard to find.  If you're not willing to
patiently work through possible hypotheses and test each one in turn, you're
probably going to find programming to be frustrating as much as it is
exhilarating.

<br><br>
If you're looking to eventually have a programming job full-time, you'll want
to acquire excess patience because you'll almost certainly be expected to
spend a great deal of time working on documenting your code for other
programmers and possibly even hunting bugs in someone else's code.

<br><br>
The benefit of all of this is that you gain an eye for small details that can
have ripple effects and you become much better at the process of asking
yourself what could go wrong and how can you test it.  Finally, you have a lot
of tools at your disposal to help mitigate the problems; you can use the
compiler to find syntax errors and debuggers to find runtime errors.  Life is
not bleak: not all of your time will be spent finding bugs!

<h2>The Importance of Precision</h2>
Third, you need to be able to <b>think in a logical, precise, rigorous
way</b>--you have to be willing and able to specify all of the details in a
process and understand exactly what goes into it.  This can lead to some
amazing realizations--for instance, you will understand almost anything better
once you've written a program to actually do it.  One story goes that a group
of programmers discovered a flaw in a state law passed by the legislature when
trying to program the logic of the law--it turned out two paragraphs made
contradictory statements!  Nobody noticed until they tried to make it easy
enough that a computer could understand it.  But it does mean that you need to
have the ability to eventually understand the entirety of a process at the
level of detail required for a computer to be able to mechanically reproduce
it.  

<h2>Framing Problems Correctly</h2>
At the same time, you must be <b>capable of framing problems the right way and
be or become a good problem solver</b>.  While your program may need to
accomplish a certain task, don't get caught up in the first way you tried to
solve the problem.  For instance, if you need to store 20 phone numbers, it
might make more sense to use an array than 20 separate variables.  Even though
you could eventually write the program that way, it would be much better to
write it with the array.  It would be a shorter program and an easier program
to maintain.  Often, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2009/04/13/restating-the-problem.aspx">restating
the problem</a> is a good way of reframing it.  This is a skill you'll learn
over time; you don't need to have mastered it before you start programming.

<br><br>
If you are persistent, willing to pay attention to issues of design and focus
on both problem solving and precise solutions to problems, you will go far as
a programmer.  If not, then you may find a programming career to be
frustrating and tedious.
